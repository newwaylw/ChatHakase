# ChatHakase
A chatbot based on Slack API and OpenAI API with streaming responses, conversation memory, and image capabilities

## Features
- üßµ **Thread-based Chat Sessions**: Each Slack thread maintains its own conversation context
- ‚ö° **Real-time Streaming**: Live message updates as the AI generates responses
- üß† **Conversation Memory**: Bot remembers previous messages within each thread
- üîÑ **Multi-user Support**: Multiple users can participate in the same thread conversation
- üõ†Ô∏è **Session Management**: Automatic session creation, tracking, and cleanup
- üìä **Admin Commands**: Session info, clearing, and statistics
- üö® **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- üî¨ **Deep Research Mode**: Advanced AI analysis using OpenAI's deep research model
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Analysis**: Upload and analyze images using GPT-4 Vision
- üé® **Image Generation**: Generate images using DALL-E 3

## How Chat Sessions Work
- **New Conversation**: Mention the bot or send a DM to start a new chat session
- **Continue Conversation**: Reply in the same thread to maintain context
- **Multiple Threads**: Each thread is a separate conversation with its own memory
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Sessions expire after 1 hour of inactivity

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Configure environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example`)
3. Run the app: `python app.py`

## Environment Variables
```bash
# Slack Bot Configuration
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token-here

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

## Usage

### Basic Chat
```
@ChatHakase Hello, can you help me with Python?
> Of course! I'd be happy to help you with Python. What would you like to learn?

What are decorators?
> [Remembers you're asking about Python] Decorators in Python are...
```

### Deep Research Mode
```
@ChatHakase /deep What are the latest developments in quantum computing and their potential impact on cryptography?
> üî¨ Deep Research Results
> 
> [Comprehensive analysis with detailed research findings...]
```

### Image Analysis
```
[Upload an image with text]
@ChatHakase What do you see in this image?
> üñºÔ∏è [Analyzes the uploaded image and provides detailed description]
```

### Image Generation
```
@ChatHakase /generate a sunset over mountains with a lake in the foreground
> üé® Generating image...
> [Posts generated image]

@ChatHakase /image a cute robot assistant
> üé® [Generates and posts the requested image]
```

### Special Commands
- `session info` - Show current session details
- `clear session` - Reset conversation history for this thread
- `all sessions` - Show all active sessions (admin)
- `help` - Show available commands

## Testing
- **Session Management**: Run `python test_sessions.py` to test session functionality
- **OpenAI Streaming**: Run `python test_streaming.py` to test OpenAI streaming without Slack
- **Deep Research**: Run `python test_deep_research.py` to test deep research functionality
- **Image Features**: Run `python test_image_features.py` to test image processing and generation

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **`app.py`**: Main Slack application with event handlers and image support
- **`assistant.py`**: OpenAI integration with streaming responses, vision, and image generation
- **`session_manager.py`**: Chat session management and conversation memory
- **`test_sessions.py`**: Test suite for session functionality
- **`test_image_features.py`**: Test suite for image functionality

### How Streaming Works
- The bot posts an initial "thinking" message
- Updates the message every 500ms with partial responses
- Shows a typing indicator (‚è≥) during generation
- Finalizes with the complete response
- Stores the conversation in session memory

### Image Processing
- **Vision Analysis**: Automatically detects uploaded images and analyzes them using GPT-4 Vision
- **Image Resizing**: Automatically resizes large images to meet OpenAI API requirements
- **Base64 Encoding**: Converts images to base64 format for API transmission
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for image processing failures

### Image Generation
- **DALL-E 3**: Uses OpenAI's latest image generation model
- **Quality Options**: Supports both standard and HD quality generation
- **Size Options**: Supports multiple image sizes (1024x1024, 1792x1024, 1024x1792)
- **Prompt Enhancement**: DALL-E 3 automatically enhances prompts for better results

### Session Management
- Sessions are identified by `channel_id + thread_timestamp`
- Each session maintains conversation history including image interactions
- OpenAI receives full context for better responses
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks

## New Image Commands

### Image Analysis Commands
- Upload any image file to Slack and mention the bot
- Add text with your image to ask specific questions
- Supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and other common image formats

### Image Generation Commands
- `/generate <description>` - Generate an image using DALL-E 3
- `/image <description>` - Alternative command for image generation
- Examples:
  - `/generate a futuristic cityscape at night`
  - `/image a cute cat wearing a space helmet`
